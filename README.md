# How to Play
- The web app will choose a random number between 1 to 100, and we have to guess the number.
- It will show a message saying *"The number is too high!"* if we guessed a number greater than the correct answer.
- Similarly, a message saying *"The number is too low!"* will be displayed if we guessed a number lower than the correct answer.
